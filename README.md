# o365Token
Sample application code for generating an Authorization token from O365.
The project initially focused on Office 365 Add-ins but was extended to cover O365 Authentication and Authorization from anywhere.

# What it does
This sample application will allow you ro return an OAuth Authorization token for use with O365. What you do with it will depend on the set up.
The project assumes that you have your O365 environment associated with Azure AD as your directory source.

# Instructions
Clone the repository
Create your Azure AD site and make the redirect URL match the sample/index.html path.

e.g. https://yoursite.azurewebsites.net/sample/index.html

Modify the following token parameters in app.js to match your application

# Release notes

Version 1.0
* This release demonstrates the ability to create an Authorization key within the Outlook Add-in itself. There is no need for using a Dialog or window.opener.


Version 0.3
* Added O365Chrome_Extension Example

Version 0.2
* Added document.cookie caching.
* New parameter also created for passing Add-In name to the Cookie getters and setters
* The token is now cached for 3600 seconds as a cookie in the domain of the hosted add-in. That means if the user needs to use the Add-In again within 60 minutes the popup window will not appear.
* This cookie needs to be set for each Add-In because the necessary permissions and end-points will always be different

Version 0.1
* Initial release
